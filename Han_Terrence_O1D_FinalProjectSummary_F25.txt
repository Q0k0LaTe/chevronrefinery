Health Indicators
The health data tells the sad story, named environmental injustice. Emergency room visits for asthma rates so high in the areas that are immediately adjacent to Chevron's fence line: ZIP codes 94801 (North Richmond) and 94804 (Iron Triangle). Sadly, children, living in these neighborhoods, have a hospitalized rate because of respiratory illness, at least at twice the county average. The rates are even higher in the days of major flaring events at the refinery.

The cancer risk maps on CalEnviroScreen showed how the increased exposure to benzene and other carcinogens. Concentrated along the rail corridor that runs between residential areas and Chevron's storage tanks, the chemicals causes long-term residents with chronic health conditions, such as asthma. While these diseases rarely appear in Richmond's wealthier, and often whiter neighborhoods. Constant coughs, asthma, frequent nosebleeds, and so on.


Key Pollutants
PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter): Airborne particulate matter (PM) is not a single pollutant, but rather is a mixture of many chemical species. It is a complex mixture of solids and aerosols composed of small droplets of liquid, dry solid fragments, and solid cores with liquid coatings. Particles vary widely in size, shape and chemical composition, and may contain inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the earth’s crust. Particles are defined by their diameter for air quality regulatory purposes. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5). Therefore, PM2.5 comprises a portion of PM10. (https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health) Chevron's flaring and processing units are major sources.
Benzene: A known carcinogen which have a direct causes to leukemia and other blood cancers. Benzene levels usually increase dramatically in flaring events. Oftentimes residents report a sweet chemical smell.
SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide): these chemicals triggers acute respiratory distress, especially in children and elderly residents.

Community Testimonies
The numbers or data is not the full picture. Instead, residents are. People describe that if they wake up and have a the taste of metal in their mouths, they know that the refinery is running. On bad air days, parents will keep their children inside their home, and will close every windows to prevent air pollutions, regardless of the heat. Some elders even talked about feelings such as burning throats, chronic headaches, and the anxiety it brings.

One mother, resident in North Richmond, told the organizers at APEN: "My son has had asthma since he was three. His inhaler doesn't work on flare days. I've taken him to the ER five times this year." There were more stories like these along the fence line, where the experience of the residents confirms the figures and data: the Chevron Refinery is a chronic health threat.

Community organizations such as APEN collect all these testimonies in order to push the government for stronger environmental monitoring, faster public alerts and response to toxic releases, and meaningful penalties for Chevron if they violates air quality permits. It is these voices that transformed abstract pollution data into human suffering, and keep fighting against environmental injustice.

Hazardous by Design

In 1937, a government group called HOLC made maps of Richmond. They showed which places were “safe” for banks to give home loans.
North and West Richmond were colored red. Red meant “dangerous.”

The report said these areas were “bad” because they were close to Standard Oil (Chevron refinery).
Because of these maps, banks did not give loans in these red places. House prices did not grow.
The city put more dirty factories and railroads next to these neighborhoods.

The “danger” was not really the factory.
The danger was how the government and banks saw people who lived there.
They linked pollution to Black, Asian, and Latino families and called the area “inferior.”

A–B zones were called “Best” and “Still Desirable.”
These were mostly white areas, far from heavy industry.

C–D zones were called “Declining” and “Hazardous.”
These were close to refineries and rail yards.
Black, Asian, and Latino families were pushed into these areas.

How Segregation Happened

Segregation in Richmond did not happen by accident.
It was made by rules and policies.

Property rules said that people “of African, Chinese, Japanese, or Mongolian descent” could not buy homes in white areas.
Real estate agents were told not to sell homes to “different races” in white neighborhoods.
So Black and Asian families were guided to the same polluted areas.

During World War II, many workers came to Richmond to work in the shipyards.
The government built temporary housing in North Richmond, next to refineries.
After the war, white workers moved away to new suburbs.
Black and Asian families could not get loans to move, so they stayed in polluted areas.

City planners made the land near Chevron into heavy industrial zones.
They allowed more homes there than in white areas, but it meant more pollution for those families.
This pattern still continues today.

Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN)

APEN began in 1993.
They organize Laotian refugee families who live in North Richmond.

These families lived in cheap housing inside the refinery pollution zone.
APEN workers knock on doors, speak many languages, and help people speak at government meetings.

APEN has won important changes:

Stronger pollution rules

Air monitors that show pollution in real time

Emergency alerts in many languages

Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA)

RPA started in 2003.
It is a group of local people who want to reduce Chevron’s power.

For many years, Chevron gave money to City Council members.
The council did whatever Chevron wanted.

RPA ran candidates who refused oil money.
They won elections.
Now people at City Council meetings asked for stricter rules, not automatic approval for Chevron.

RPA leaders, like Mayor Gayle McLaughlin and Eduardo Martinez, changed many policies:

Higher taxes for Chevron

Better safety checks

Agreements for Chevron to help the community

They showed that people can win against a huge company.

Communities for a Better Environment (CBE)

CBE uses law, organizing, and youth leadership.

Their lawyers have sued Chevron many times.
They forced the refinery to install better pollution controls.

CBE also trains young people from Richmond.
These students speak at City Council, run air monitors, and protest outside the refinery.

Community air monitors gave real data.
Now when Chevron says a fire was “small,” residents can check themselves and prove the truth.

Important Moments
2012 Refinery Fire

A big fire sent toxic smoke over Richmond.
15,000 people went to the hospital.
This event made many people angry and created strong organizing.

Rule 6-5

After years of pressure, the air district made strong limits on refinery pollution.
Chevron fought this for many years but lost.

Elections

RPA candidates won City Council seats.
This changed the city’s politics.

Community Benefits

Chevron now has to spend money on:

clinics

job training

green projects

These projects help people who live closest to the pollution.

“We Are Not a Sacrifice Zone”

Richmond organizers say this:
We are not a place for others to throw away.
Our lives are not less important.

They connect environmental health with:

housing

immigrant rights

labor rights

democracy

People who live near the pollution are not just victims.
They are leaders and experts.

They speak many languages, collect data, go to meetings, and run elections.
Richmond shows how a community can fight the long history of redlining and industrial racism.

As one APEN organizer said:

“They put the refinery next to us because they thought we wouldn’t fight back.
They were wrong.”

    <p>Richmond is not just a victim; it is a leader in the Environmental Justice movement.</p>

            <h3>Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN)</h3>
            <p>APEN began in 1993. They organize Laotian refugee families who live in North Richmond.</p>

            <p>These families lived in cheap housing inside the refinery pollution zone. APEN workers knock on doors, speak many languages, and help people speak at government meetings.</p>

            <p>APEN has won important changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stronger pollution rules</li>
                <li>Air monitors that show pollution in real time</li>
                <li>Emergency alerts in many languages</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA)</h3>
            <p>RPA started in 2003. It is a group of local people who want to reduce Chevron's power.</p>

            <p>For many years, Chevron gave money to City Council members. The council did whatever Chevron wanted.</p>

            <p>RPA ran candidates who refused oil money. They won elections. Now people at City Council meetings asked for stricter rules, not automatic approval for Chevron.</p>

            <p>RPA leaders, like Mayor Gayle McLaughlin and Eduardo Martinez, changed many policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Higher taxes for Chevron</li>
                <li>Better safety checks</li>
                <li>Agreements for Chevron to help the community</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They showed that people can win against a huge company.</p>

            <h3>Communities for a Better Environment (CBE)</h3>
            <p>CBE uses law, organizing, and youth leadership.</p>

            <p>Their lawyers have sued Chevron many times. They forced the refinery to install better pollution controls.</p>

            <p>CBE also trains young people from Richmond. These students speak at City Council, run air monitors, and protest outside the refinery.</p>

            <p>Community air monitors gave real data. Now when Chevron says a fire was "small," residents can check themselves and prove the truth.</p>

            <h3>Important Moments</h3>
            <p><strong>2012 Refinery Fire</strong></p>
            <p>A big fire sent toxic smoke over Richmond. 15,000 people went to the hospital. This event made many people angry and created strong organizing.</p>

            <p><strong>Rule 6-5</strong></p>
            <p>After years of pressure, the air district made strong limits on refinery pollution. Chevron fought this for many years but lost.</p>

            <p><strong>Elections</strong></p>
            <p>RPA candidates won City Council seats. This changed the city's politics.</p>

            <p><strong>Community Benefits</strong></p>
            <p>Chevron now has to spend money on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>clinics</li>
                <li>job training</li>
                <li>green projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These projects help people who live closest to the pollution.</p>

        <h3>"We Are Not a Sacrifice Zone"</h3>
        <p>Richmond organizers say this: We are not a place for others to throw away. Our lives are not less important.</p>

        <p>They connect environmental health with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>housing</li>
            <li>immigrant rights</li>
            <li>labor rights</li>
            <li>democracy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>People who live near the pollution are not just victims. They are leaders and experts.</p>

        <p>They speak many languages, collect data, go to meetings, and run elections. Richmond shows how a community can fight the long history of redlining and industrial racism.</p>

        <p>As one APEN organizer said:</p>
        <p><em>"They put the refinery next to us because they thought we wouldn't fight back. They were wrong."</em></p>

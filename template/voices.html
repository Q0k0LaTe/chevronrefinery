                <li><strong>Iron Triangle parent:</strong> “We keep inhalers in every backpack because the flares make my kids wheeze.”</li>
                <li><strong>North Richmond elder:</strong> “We were steered here during the war; the refinery has never left us.”</li>
                <li><strong>Youth organizer:</strong> “EJ is about housing, jobs, and air—one fight.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">These testimonies draw from APEN’s community listening sessions and local reporting after major flare events.</p>

            <h3>Quotes From the Fence Line</h3>
            <p>“During the 2012 fire, we didn’t know where to go. Sirens blared but no one told us if the air was safe.”</p>
            <p>“Chevron’s donations don’t clean the air—we need monitoring and real caps on emissions.”</p>

            <h3>Why Voices Matter</h3>
            <p>Environmental justice insists that impacted residents define the problem and the solutions. Their testimonies pressure regulators, shape public health protocols, and keep corporations accountable.</p>

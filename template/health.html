            <h3>Health Indicators</h3>
            <p>The health data tells the sad story, named environmental injustice. Emergency room visits for asthma rates so high in the areas that are immediately adjacent to Chevron's fence line: ZIP codes 94801 (North Richmond) and 94804 (Iron Triangle). Sadly, children, living in these neighborhoods, have a hospitalized rate because of respiratory illness, at least at twice the county average. The rates are even higher in the days of major flaring events at the refinery.</p>

            <p>The cancer risk maps on CalEnviroScreen showed how the increased exposure to benzene and other carcinogens. Concentrated along the rail corridor that runs between residential areas and Chevron's storage tanks, the chemicals causes long-term residents with chronic health conditions, such as asthma. While these diseases rarely appear in Richmond's wealthier, and often whiter neighborhoods. Constant coughs, asthma, frequent nosebleeds, and so on.</p>

            <h3>Key Pollutants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter):</strong> Airborne particulate matter (PM) is not a single pollutant, but rather is a mixture of many chemical species. It is a complex mixture of solids and aerosols composed of small droplets of liquid, dry solid fragments, and solid cores with liquid coatings. Particles vary widely in size, shape and chemical composition, and may contain inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and compounds from the earth's crust. Particles are defined by their diameter for air quality regulatory purposes. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5). Therefore, PM2.5 comprises a portion of PM10. (<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health" target="_blank">source</a>) Chevron's flaring and processing units are major sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Benzene:</strong> A known carcinogen which have a direct causes to leukemia and other blood cancers. Benzene levels usually increase dramatically in flaring events. Oftentimes residents report a sweet chemical smell.</li>
                <li><strong>SO<sub>2</sub> (Sulfur Dioxide):</strong> These chemicals triggers acute respiratory distress, especially in children and elderly residents.</li>

            <h3>Community Testimonies</h3>
            <p>The numbers or data is not the full picture. Instead, residents are. People describe that if they wake up and have a the taste of metal in their mouths, they know that the refinery is running. On bad air days, parents will keep their children inside their home, and will close every windows to prevent air pollutions, regardless of the heat. Some elders even talked about feelings such as burning throats, chronic headaches, and the anxiety it brings.</p>

            <p>One mother, resident in North Richmond, told the organizers at APEN: "My son has had asthma since he was three. His inhaler doesn't work on flare days. I've taken him to the ER five times this year." There were more stories like these along the fence line, where the experience of the residents confirms the figures and data: the Chevron Refinery is a chronic health threat.</p>

            <p>Community organizations such as APEN collect all these testimonies in order to push the government for stronger environmental monitoring, faster public alerts and response to toxic releases, and meaningful penalties for Chevron if they violates air quality permits. It is these voices that transformed abstract pollution data into human suffering, and keep fighting against environmental injustice.</p>

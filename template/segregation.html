    <h1>Redlining & Segregation</h1>
    <p class="lead">Mapping Inequality’s 1937 survey steered Black, Asian, and Latino families toward the very land zoned for heavy industry—laying the groundwork for today’s refinery fence-line neighborhoods.</p>

            <h3>Hazardous by Design</h3>
            <p>In 1937, a government group called HOLC made maps of Richmond. They showed which places were "safe" for banks to give home loans. North and West Richmond were colored red. Red meant "dangerous."</p>

            <p>The report said these areas were "bad" because they were close to Standard Oil (Chevron refinery). Because of these maps, banks did not give loans in these red places. House prices did not grow. The city put more dirty factories and railroads next to these neighborhoods.</p>

            <p>The "danger" was not really the factory. The danger was how the government and banks saw people who lived there. They linked pollution to Black, Asian, and Latino families and called the area "inferior."</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A–B zones</strong> were called "Best" and "Still Desirable." These were mostly white areas, far from heavy industry.</li>
                <li><strong>C–D zones</strong> were called "Declining" and "Hazardous." These were close to refineries and rail yards. Black, Asian, and Latino families were pushed into these areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Segregation Happened</h3>
            <p>Segregation in Richmond did not happen by accident. It was made by rules and policies.</p>

            <p>Property rules said that people "of African, Chinese, Japanese, or Mongolian descent" could not buy homes in white areas. Real estate agents were told not to sell homes to "different races" in white neighborhoods. So Black and Asian families were guided to the same polluted areas.</p>

            <p>During World War II, many workers came to Richmond to work in the shipyards. The government built temporary housing in North Richmond, next to refineries. After the war, white workers moved away to new suburbs. Black and Asian families could not get loans to move, so they stayed in polluted areas.</p>

            <p>City planners made the land near Chevron into heavy industrial zones. They allowed more homes there than in white areas, but it meant more pollution for those families. This pattern still continues today.</p>

                <h4>Why It Matters Today</h4>
                <p>Current asthma and cancer risks still follow these 1930s boundaries—proving that historical maps don't just predict modern health outcomes, they determine them. The fence-line communities of North Richmond and the Iron Triangle remain predominantly communities of color, and their residents still breathe the legacy of redlining every day.</p>
